People all around the world, whether they are from an Eastern or Western culture, meeting with extended families is always seen as important. But with the pandemic, neither of them can meet up based on their habits and traditions. <br><br>So how does the pandemic affect them?
	Take Chinese as an example, the Chinese new year is coming up, and as tradition, different nuclear family would meet up with their extended families, people would traditionally have a meal together, exchange red pockets and simply celebrate. However, this year, the pandemic bans different families from meeting and having a meal together as it will increase the risk of infection.

							<strong>How do I safely meet up with family?</strong><br><br>
	In order to solve the boredom and social distancing problems, try to hold online gatherings! If you insists to gather in person, be sure that it is not a large gathering and you have sufficient amount of hygiene resources like masks, hand sanitizers etc. and be sure to keep your masks on and social distancing of at least one meter.

							<ul class="friendlist">
								<li>At no point should you frivolously give personal information without second consideration.</li>
								<li>When you decide to visit websites or download apps or was even asked to fill in your personal information for certain benefits.</li>
								<li>Be sure to download apps to keep check of your cybersecurity. Personally, we recommend <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes</a> for Windows and <a href ="https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac">CleanMyMacX</a> for Mac because we found that they are reliable. </li>
								<li>Additionaslly, installing restrictions to certain unsafe websites is also a good idea.</li>

You may think that they are the people who understand you most and feel secure when communicating with them. However, the possibility of false sense of security for online friends or relationships still exists. you have to beware of the dangers which mostly includes sexual predators, thieves, blackmailers… you would never know who is actually behind the phone talking to you. <br><br>
	<strong>So what are the solutions to this?</strong><br><br>If you really found someone online who you want to be friends or have a relationship with, try requesting to call and facetime, as long as you're not just texting. However, you have to be mentally prepared that this relationship <strong>can end in seconds</strong>. With that in mind, you can know each other more through talking conversation, stay in touch and better bond your friendship! Unless you know your online friend really well, >do not give away your passwords to social media, bank accounts etc. As long as you set suitable boundaries, you're safe to make new friends online during these isolated times. Good luck!

Not being able to meet up with extended family 
	Each family has their own  habit of meeting with extended families, some will meet once a week, some meets once in a month or even just in holidays and festivals.  Asians and westerns are the two main culture of meeting with extended families but with the pandemic, neither of them can meet up based on their habits and traditions. 
So how does the pandemic affects them? 
	Take Chinese as an example, the Chinese new year is coming up and as tradition, different nuclear family would meet up with their extended families, people would traditionally have a meal together, exchange red pockets and simply celebrate. However this year, the pandemic bans different families from meeting and having a meal together as it will increase the risk of infection. 
	On the other hand, western families tend to enjoy meeting and gathering in weekends for all short of activities, BBQ in the backyard, footballs, pool parties…. They tend to choose to enjoy life with friends and families, but again, with the pandemic striking the whole world, these activities were banned or decreased. 
	So both culture of tradition and hobby on meeting up with extended family leads to one problem, the obstacle of meeting up together. To solve the boredom and social distancing problems, try to hold online gatherings!! If you insists to gather in person, be sure that it is not a large gathering and you have sufficient amount of hygiene resources like masks, hand sanitizers etc. and be sure to keep your masks on and social distancing of at least one meter.
