	Take Chinese as an example, the Chinese new year is coming up, and as tradition, different nuclear family would meet up with their extended families, people would traditionally have a meal together, exchange red pockets and simply celebrate.

	On the other hand, western families tend to enjoy meeting and gathering in weekends for all short of activities, BBQ in the backyard, Super Bowl parties, American Thanksgiving… They tend to choose to enjoy life with friends and families, but again, with the pandemic striking the whole world, these activities were banned or decreased. <br><br>
							<strong>How do I safely meet up with family?</strong><br><br>
	In order to solve the boredom and social distancing problems, try to hold online gatherings! If you insists to gather in person, be sure that it is not a large gathering and you have sufficient amount of hygiene resources like masks, hand sanitizers etc. and be sure to keep your masks on and social distancing of at least one meter.

                        <p>As society develops, more and more people feel distanced from others. However, "Humans are wired to come together physically," says psychologist Judith Moskowitz of Northwestern University. The lockdowns imposed with the pandemic made the issue of loneliness far worse. Students are forced to study online, essentially taking away the one thing that most people find enjoyable about school—being able to meet friends. 
<br><br>
Luckily, we have some solutions if you’re stuck at home and feeling a little bit down because you are alone.

<ul class="friendlist"><li>Art can be a good way to express yourself and get other people’s attention. It can be very powerful for centring and positioning — a way to explore your own identity and meet new people. You can make fan art, post edits, and gather a circle of friends with your own interest to keep yourself entertained. </li><li>
Keeping friendships alive with small acts of kindness. Even something simple and small can help you maintain a friendship and make yourself feel fulfilled. By helping someone, talking to them when they’re down, or even just sharing a joke, all keep your friendship afloat.</li></ul>

Not being able to meet up with extended family 
	Each family has their own  habit of meeting with extended families, some will meet once a week, some meets once in a month or even just in holidays and festivals.  Asians and westerns are the two main culture of meeting with extended families but with the pandemic, neither of them can meet up based on their habits and traditions. 
So how does the pandemic affects them? 
	Take Chinese as an example, the Chinese new year is coming up and as tradition, different nuclear family would meet up with their extended families, people would traditionally have a meal together, exchange red pockets and simply celebrate. However this year, the pandemic bans different families from meeting and having a meal together as it will increase the risk of infection. 
	On the other hand, western families tend to enjoy meeting and gathering in weekends for all short of activities, BBQ in the backyard, footballs, pool parties…. They tend to choose to enjoy life with friends and families, but again, with the pandemic striking the whole world, these activities were banned or decreased. 
	So both culture of tradition and hobby on meeting up with extended family leads to one problem, the obstacle of meeting up together. To solve the boredom and social distancing problems, try to hold online gatherings!! If you insists to gather in person, be sure that it is not a large gathering and you have sufficient amount of hygiene resources like masks, hand sanitizers etc. and be sure to keep your masks on and social distancing of at least one meter.

Not being to meet up with friends 
	With the pandemic restrictions, the chances to meet up with friends are no doubt decreased or even none. for example in Hong Kong, you can only go into the streets in a pair at most, which means you can only go out with one friend at most and though these policies are built or set to protect you from the virus, it affects and this you on your social life, it distances your relationships with your best friends or even shrinks your social circle. 
So what can you do to at least improve the situation?
•	If you all love to play video games, make an appointment with your best friends and game online together, you can enjoy the moment, release stress and bond with your friends during games. 
•	If you don’t enjoy gaming, have group calls, facetime, zoom, chat with one another during spare time, this will avoid loneliness and gives you access to communicate with the friends you miss!

Cybersecurity 
	Without many activities to take part in during the pandemic, most students tend to spend their time on social media. However, most students are not aware of the different dangers they may face online. For example, there are many incidents related to the scamming of money or stolen personal data. 
	Therefore when you decide to visits websites or download apps or was even asked to fill in your personal information for certain benefits. Be aware of cybersecurity threats!! Be sure to download apps to keep check of your cybersecurity and install restrictions to certain unsafe websites.
