                        <p>With governments advising citizens to stay at home to prevent the risk of infection, there are less and less chances for students to go out for a walk or some exercise. Even with the chance to go exercise, the law forces us to have to wear masks outdoors to protect both others and our own health. Therefore, it is extremely hard to do any kind of exercise outdoors, especially more exhausting ones. The only solution left is to do exercise at home. But what can you do with limited space and equipment? Actually, there is so much you can do. Here is a sample workout plan that just uses a yoga mat and can be done in a few minutes just at home. No more excuses!
<ul class="friendlist">
	<li>20 Bodyweight squats.</li>
	<li>10 Push-ups.</li>
	<li>10 Walking lunges (each leg).</li>
	<li>10 Dumbbell rows (use a milk jug or other weight).</li>

                        <p>As mentioned above, it is harder and harder for students to go outdoors. A consequence of that is the lack of sunlight. Sunlight helps the human body to produce vitamin D, which is used to maintain calcium to prevent brittle, thin, or misshapen bones. A deficiency of vitamin D can lead to loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones). 
							<br><br>
							<strong>How do I get more vitamin D?</strong>
							<br><br>
Of course, one simple solution is to try to be under the sunlight more often. It is recommended to get 8-15 minutes of exposure to sunlight every day. However, it is understood that it may be very difficult to get exposure to sunlight during the pandemic. Luckily, there are dietary sources of vitamin D. Some common sources include dark, fatty fish, fortified dairy and cereal products, mushrooms, and fortified orange juice.

                        <p>During the pandemic, a lot of schools have switched to online classes. Therefore, students have to stare at a screen for a few hours a day continuously. When it comes to higher year levels, students may have to look at a monitor for over 5-8 hours. Another cause is that students are now forced to socialise with each other online in chat apps or social media. Excessive screen time not only strains your eyes and leaves them feeling dry, but can also lead to retina damage and blurred vision. Other problems include sleep deprivation, loss of cognitive ability and impaired socialising skills.
<br> <br>
<strong>How do I control my screen time?
</strong>							<br><br>
When using a screen for leisure, you can limit yourself to around 2 hours a day to prevent addiction. Also, around 30 minutes of screen time, you should allow your eyes to rest by looking at some greenery in the distance out the window or just by closing them. You can also do some stretching exercises to your eyes to relieve the strain. However, when it comes to online lessons, you can’t really control your screen time, or just rest your eyes in the middle of a lesson. Therefore, you must utilize the break time between lessons. During the breaks, relieve your eyes from looking at a screen and allow it to rest.

Not being able to meet up with extended family 
	Each family has their own  habit of meeting with extended families, some will meet once a week, some meets once in a month or even just in holidays and festivals.  Asians and westerns are the two main culture of meeting with extended families but with the pandemic, neither of them can meet up based on their habits and traditions. 
So how does the pandemic affects them? 
	Take Chinese as an example, the Chinese new year is coming up and as tradition, different nuclear family would meet up with their extended families, people would traditionally have a meal together, exchange red pockets and simply celebrate. However this year, the pandemic bans different families from meeting and having a meal together as it will increase the risk of infection. 
	On the other hand, western families tend to enjoy meeting and gathering in weekends for all short of activities, BBQ in the backyard, footballs, pool parties…. They tend to choose to enjoy life with friends and families, but again, with the pandemic striking the whole world, these activities were banned or decreased. 
	So both culture of tradition and hobby on meeting up with extended family leads to one problem, the obstacle of meeting up together. To solve the boredom and social distancing problems, try to hold online gatherings!! If you insists to gather in person, be sure that it is not a large gathering and you have sufficient amount of hygiene resources like masks, hand sanitizers etc. and be sure to keep your masks on and social distancing of at least one meter. For more guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html
Not being to meet up with friends 
	With the pandemic restrictions, the chances to meet up with friends are no doubt decreased or even none. for example in Hong Kong, you can only go into the streets in a pair at most, which means you can only go out with one friend at most and though these policies are built or set to protect you from the virus, it affects and this you on your social life, it distances your relationships with your best friends or even shrinks your social circle. 
So what can you do to at least improve the situation?
•	If you all love to play video games, make an appointment with your best friends and game online together, you can enjoy the moment, release stress and bond with your friends during games. 
•	If you don’t enjoy gaming, have group calls, facetime, zoom, chat with one another during spare time, this will avoid loneliness and gives you access to communicate with the friends you miss!

Cybersecurity 
	Without many activities to take part in during the pandemic, most students tend to spend their time on social media. However, most students are not aware of the different dangers they may face online. For example, there are many incidents related to the scamming of money or stolen personal data. 
	Therefore when you decide to visits websites or download apps or was even asked to fill in your personal information for certain benefits. Be aware of cybersecurity threats!! Be sure to download apps to keep check of your cybersecurity and install restrictions to certain unsafe websites. 
	If you would like to know more you can click into this link and learn more about how to identify and respond to cyber threats: https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/how-to-identify-and-respond-to-cyber-threats

A false sense of security for online friends/ relationship 
	In the pandemic times, you will have more access in the internet and even make new online friends,  you may think that they are the people who understand you most and feel secure when communicating with them. but the possibility of false sense of security for online friend or relationships still exists. you have to beware of the dangers which mostly includes sexual predators, thieves, blackmailers… you would never know who is actually behind the phone talking to you. 
	So what are the solutions? If you really found someone online who you want to be friends or have a relationship with, try requesting to call and facetime, as long as your not just texting. You can know each other more through talking conversation, stay in touch and better bond your friendship! Unless your know your online friend really well, do not give away your passwords to social media, bank accounts etc. do not give personal information. As long as you set suitable boundaries, your safe to make new friends online during these isolated times. Good luck!
